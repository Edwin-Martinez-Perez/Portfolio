      Hello! My name is Edwin Martinez-Perez. Growing up, I've always known that it was my mission to help me. 
      As a recent grad from North Central College where I studied computer science, I look forward to using the skills I've learned to help people. 
      I aspire to be a web developer so I can help individuals and orginazations get their message across to as many people as possible. I hope that through my work I can help
      connect people to resources they need, or help people get the information they need. Some of favorite hobbies are running and lifting. I also enjoy spending time outside with my dog Marley or
      doing other activities.
